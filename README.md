Media consumption tracking flask app

I'm trying out a bunch of technologies with this one. Obviously, Flask. Loosely following 
the Flask book from Packt publishing entitled
'Mastering Flask Web Development: second edition' by Daniel Gaspar 

Also trying out the uv python packagemenagment system.

Created virtual python environment with uv:
uv venv --python 3.13
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate

Install packages
uv pip install <package name>
